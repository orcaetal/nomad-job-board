My late husband worked in construction and I am no stranger to big projects so I am looking to hire a competent \u201cDIY\u201d kinda guy to assist me in that endeavor. I am tired of waiting for his old co-workers to help me.\n\nI will provide all materials and tools, the job needs to be bid and completed in phases, working alongside me. \n\nIf I am content with your work, you may bid subsequent phases, and provided it is as competitive as your original bid, I will likely accept your bid -due to the likelihood of being comfortable working with you.\n\nThe scope of the project entails:\n\nPhase One:\n\nCutting 5/8th inch Sheetrock and coat it in green glue, then using a drywall lift to secure it to the ceiling using screws and a power drill with \u201cdimple bit.\u201d\n\nApplying bulk bucket green glue to a second layer of [offset] 5/8ths inch Sheetrock and securing it to the first layer on the ceiling.\n\nSealing gaps around the edges and between the gaps with green glue sealant\n\nPhase two:\n\nCutting and installing 6 1/2\u201d Safe and sound insulation while leaving an \u201cair gap\u201d between the insulation and the Sheetrock.\n\nLeaving an air gap and installing a second layer of safe and sound insulation.\n\nPhase three:\n\nInstalling resilient channel hangers and channels on the 24\u201d on center joists.\n\nInstalling a layer of 1/2\u201d Sheetrock on the resilient channels\n\nApplying green glue and screwing a second sheet of 1/2 Sheetrock to the first layer.\n\nI will be working with the person I hire as I have some construction experience. If you prefer, I will tell you WHAT I want done, but not HOW to do it. I built a tiny house a few years ago and have a general idea of what is required and I also have a contractor friend we can consult if we get in a tough spot.\n\nI planned to do this project with my husband who worked in construction, but he died in October. I will collect bids until March 30th and start work on either March 31st or April 7th (whichever works better for my assistant) with a completion date goal of April 11th, contingent upon our scheduling and product availability. If you need to work only weekends, that can be arranged.\n\nI will pay in cash at the end of the job, but regret I am not able to accept any hourly bids or \u201cestimates.\u201d Due to limited finances (being a widow, we had no life insurance) I need a firm bid for each phase of the work that will be completed with my assistance.\n\nThank you!!\n    ", "link": "https://seattle.craigslist.org/oly/lbg/d/olympia-three-phase-project-for-600-sq/7463381286.html"}, {"datePosted": "2022-03-26 ", "region": "NW", "city": "Seattle, WA", "jobTitle": "Temp gig - 1 to 3 days", "jobDesc": "\n\nQR Code Link to This Post\n\n\nSeeking a young & nimble helper to assist with cleaning, organizing & moving some tools/supplies\n\nWork is located in Seattle's Fremont \n\nPays cash \n\n1 to 3 day job \n\nWork is available immediately \n\nPlease send a brief description of yourself and a contact number* you can be directly reached at\n    ", "link": "https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/lbg/d/seattle-temp-gig-to-days/7463378582.html"}, {"datePosted": "2022-03-26 ", "region": "NW", "city": "Seattle, WA", "jobTitle": "Plumber needed urgently", "jobDesc": "\n\nQR Code Link to This Post\n\n\nif you are licensed and/or experienced plumber pls call or msg right now. 281.746.8784\n", "link": "https://seattle.craigslist.org/tac/lbg/d/rickreall-plumber-needed-urgently/7463368985.html"}, {"datePosted": "2022-03-26 ", "region": "NW", "city": "Seattle, WA", "jobTitle": "Site clean-up / digging / concrete loading", "jobDesc": "\n\nQR Code Link to This Post\n\n\nI am looking for someone to help fill in for 3 to 4 days to help load broken Concrete into trailers, help dig some trenches, help to do yard cleanup, and provide miscellaneous task support.\n\nCan pay daily, and we'll only need this for this coming week.\n    ", "link": "https://seattle.craigslist.org/est/lbg/d/woodinville-site-clean-up-digging/7463357802.html"}, {"datePosted": "2022-03-26 ", "region": "NW", "city": "Eugene, OR", "jobTitle": "Shopper Gig Work - Shop and Deliver", "jobDesc": "\n\nQR Code Link to This Post\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nShop and deliver on a flexible schedule AND earn additional income!Be a household hero with Instacart.\n\u00a0\n\nWHY SHOP & DELIVER WITH INSTACART?\nInstacart is the North American leader in online groceries (and so much more) from a huge number of stores.

A career that is easy, flexible, extremely rewarding and provides you with a true residual income and an over the top early retirement program?\n\nOur company \u201cSnap Delivered\u201d is a new food delivery app that has figured out how to do delivery better, and we are looking for motivated individuals like you to introduce Restaurants, Drivers & Customers to our platform. This is extremely easy to do as it is 100% free, and our value proposition is extraordinary.\n\nSo, what makes us different and what\u2019s in it for you?\n\nRestaurants that use one of the big 3rd party delivery apps, and you know who they are, they are charged \u201cup to\u201d 35% of the meal price as a commission to the delivery app that facilitates that transaction. That means that if the order is $40, the restaurant is charged up to $14. That is eating up most of their profits.\n\nWell, Snap Delivered is here to give the vast majority of that money back to the Restaurant owner and inject 60% of their profits back into the local communities to support and reward the Restaurants, Drivers, Customers & Organizations that use and share the Snap Delivered App.\n\nWith Snap Delivered, we only charge the Restaurant a flat $2 per delivery regardless of the size of the order instead of the 25% to 35% like the rest of the delivery apps.\n\nThis saves the restaurant 10\u2019s of thousands of dollar each year in delivery fees!\n\nAnd if you sign up that Restaurant for FREE, you earn .40 cents for every delivery that goes out their door. You also earn $.50 cents for every order the Restaurants customers make through the app and .10 to .20 cents for every delivery the drivers complete. This is all in perpetuity. It\u2019s the epitome, the crown jewel, the holy grail of residual income!\n\nLet\u2019s look at some numbers:\n\nIf you sign up 10 Restaurants for FREE and they do 20 deliveries a day each, that is 200 deliveries per day collectively. 200 deliveries at .40 Cents = $80 a day or $2,400 a month in passive residual income. Now, add the .50 cents from customer over-rides and .10 cents from the drivers and you are earning $6,000 per month from those same 10 restaurants! And 20 deliveries a day is conservative. A lot of Restaurants do 100 to 150 plus deliveries a day.\n\nAnd, several Snap Delivered affiliates are signing up 10 restaurants in their 1st week. Think about that, securing an early retirement income in only 1 week! Many people work 40 hours a week for 40 years and don\u2019t get a retirement like that.\n\nDo this 9 more times and you are earning $60,000 per month!\n\nAnd if you are the type of person who wants to build teams, you can over-ride the production of hundreds and even thousands of Restaurants, Drivers & Customers that your team refers to Snap Delivered and create generational wealth.\n\nYou can work with us full time or part time and you choose when and where you want to work. We have all of the print ready marketing collateral created for you, and daily trainings that you can participate in to learn all the aspects of Snap Delivered. This is completely turn-key and ready for you to create life-changing results on day one!\n\nSnap Delivered offers a dream career opportunity. There are not many industries in the world that allow you to create total financial freedom in a very, very short period of time and with zero investment.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next? It\u2019s really simple. Submit your application below and we will contact you to answer any questions and set you up for maximum success.\n\nWe look forward to helping you create a career that you can be proud of.
